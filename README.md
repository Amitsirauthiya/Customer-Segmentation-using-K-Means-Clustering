# Customer-Segmentation-using-K-Means-Clustering
1.	Introduction

•	Customer Segmentation is the subdivision of a market into discrete customer groups that share similar characteristics. Customer Segmentation can be a powerful means to identify unsatisfied customer needs. Using the above data companies can then outperform the competition by developing uniquely appealing products and services.

•	Clustering is a technique for finding comparable groups of data in a large dataset. Members of each group are more alike than members of other groupings. Cluster-based segmentation has been popular in data analysis since the 1970s, particularly in marketing. Clustering is not a systematic data analysis approach, and although it provides a lot of flexibility, it is very dependent on the data or sample utilized, as pointed out by. The "tandem technique," which consists of two processes, one of which the first is factor analysis, while the second is cluster analysis, is a combination of factor and cluster analysis., is a statistical strategy employed by this cluster analysis investigation. In a number of pieces, this method has been blasted. 

2.	Objective

•	The objective would be to train a model for segmentation. Customer segmentation has the potential to allow marketers to address each customer in the most effective way. Using the large amount of data available on customers (and potential customers), a customer segmentation analysis allows marketers to identify discrete groups of customers with a high degree of accuracy based on demographic, behavioral and other indicators



3.	Motivation

•	The customer segmentation has the importance as it includes, the ability to modify the programs of market so that it is suitable to each of the customer segment, support in business decision; identification of products associated with each customer segment and to mange the demand and supply of that product; identifying and targeting the potential customer base, and predicting customer defection, providing directions in finding the solutions. 




4.	Related work
•	Using data from an online retail outlet, this research offered an implementation of the k-Means clustering technique for consumer segmentation. Customers were divided into mutually exclusive groups in this model, five clusters in this case .
•	The authors chose internal clustering validation over external clustering verification since the dataset was unbalanced. External clustering verification relies on external data such as labels. Internal cluster validation can be used to choose the best clustering algorithm for the dataset and, conversely, to cluster the data within the cluster appropriately.
•	Machine learning approaches are excellent for evaluating customer data and uncovering patterns and insights. Artificially intelligent models are effective decision-making tools. They have the ability to precisely define client categories, which is far more difficult to achieve manually or with traditional analytical methods. Machine learning algorithms come in a number of flavors, each of which is best suited to a certain context. The model in this study is built on the k-means clustering technique, which is a popular machine learning algorithm for client segmentation challenges.





5.	Proposed Method

•	The number of clusters that we choose for a given dataset cannot be random. Each cluster is formed by calculating and comparing the distances of data points within a cluster to its centroid. An ideal way to figure out the right number of clusters would be to calculate the Within-Cluster-Sum-of-Squares (WCSS). WCSS is the sum of squares of the distances of each data point in all clusters to their respective centroids.

•	Elbow curve Method 
1.	The elbow method runs k-means clustering on the dataset for a range of values of k (say 1 to 10).
2.	Perform K-means clustering with all these different values of K. For each of the K values, we calculate average distances to the centroid across all data points.
3.	Plot these points and find the point where the average distance from the centroid falls suddenly (“Elbow”)
